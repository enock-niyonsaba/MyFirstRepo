What I’ve Learned About Version Control, Git, GitHub, and Best Practices

I’ve learned that version control is a system that helps track changes to files and manage code over time, allowing teams to collaborate efficiently and avoid conflicts or loss of work. One of the most popular version control systems is Git, which allows developers to create snapshots of their code (called commits) and work on different features or fixes using branches.

GitHub is a cloud-based platform that hosts Git repositories, enabling teams to share, review, and collaborate on code remotely. It supports useful features like pull requests, issues, and actions, which help with code review, bug tracking, and automation.

Some good GitHub practices I’ve learned include:

1. Writing clear and meaningful commit messages

2. Using branches for new features or bug fixes

3. Submitting pull requests for code review before merging

4. Keeping the main or master branch stable and deployable

5. Regularly syncing with the remote repository to avoid conflicts

6. Documenting the project clearly with a README.md

These tools and practices help ensure code quality, team coordination, and a smoother development process.
